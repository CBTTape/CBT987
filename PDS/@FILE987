//***FILE 987 is from Sam Golob and contains a few utilities        *   FILE 987
//*           which were rescued from the NaSPA VIP utilities tape  *   FILE 987
//*           of "old" (around 1990 or before).  They either didn't *   FILE 987
//*           work at all, or they didn't work well, under z/OS.    *   FILE 987
//*           Now (at least) they work.                             *   FILE 987
