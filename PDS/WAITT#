INVOKING: WAITT #####X    (SEE ADDED POWER, BELOW)

   WHERE: ##### IS 1 TO 5 DIGIT VALUE

              X IS H, M OR S TO SIGNIFY THAT THE VALUE IS HOURS,
                MINUTES OR SECONDS.

    NOTE: THE NUMBER OF SECONDS IS CONVERTED INTO WAIT TIME UNITS,
          EACH OF WHICH REPRESENTS 1.048576 SECONDS.  SOME VALUES
          CAN NOT BE REPRESENTED EXACTLY.  IE: 30 MINUTES IS 1800
          SECONDS OR 1716 WAIT UNITS.  WHEN 1716 WAIT UNITS ARE
          CONVERTED BACK TO SECONDS, THEY BECOME 1799 SECONDS.
          THIS IS NOT A PHENOMENON OF THE COMMAND, BUT OF MVS.

   ADDED POWER:   WAITT T  -  EXEMPTS JOB FROM STEP TIMING
                  WAITT Z  -  TURNS OFF EXEMPTION SWITCH
